    "Problem Statement\n",
    "The problem statement is divided into two cases: \n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case A : To build a banking behavioural scorecard (model) for Self-employed customers which differentiates customer's risk profile. The scorecard will be built in unsecured disbursals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will have the following usage -\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer on-boarding for cross-selling other products of the bank.\n",
    "It will help us decision customer treatment (through graded risk profile of  customer) as an input for credit underwriting.\n",
    "What is a Banking Behavioural Scorecard (model)?\n",
    "\n",
    "Banking Behavioural Scorecard is a scorecard (model) maintained for a customer based on his liability transactions. Liability transactions are transactions that are transacted by an internal customer of a bank i.e. a customer who has a current account (CA) or Savings account (SA) with the bank is an internal customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "What do you mean by Self-employed customers?\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-employed customers are non-salaried customers who have income coming from selfowned businesses i.e. Self-employed individuals, Proprietors, Private Ltd. Co. and Partnership Firms involved in the business of Manufacturing, Trading or Services.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does a customer repay a loan?\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer pays the loan in equal monthly instalments (EMIs). The loan will be paid through post-dated cheques. Customer also has an option to pay through Electronic Clearing System (ECS ) or a standing instruction to debit his HDFC Bank account with the EMI amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "What security does a customer need to provide to obtain a Business loan?\n",
    "\n",
    "To obtain the loan, there is absolutely no need to provide any security or collateral.\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the loan tenure options for Business Loan?\n",
    "\n",
    "A customer can repay his loan over a period of 12 to 48 months.\n",
    "\n",
    "What does customer risk profile mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "Customer risk profile means the probability of the customer defaulting on his EMI payment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Case B : \n",
    "\n",
    "Describe your approach for the above built model and your reasons for the same\n",
    "Describe model segmentation (if any)\n",
    "Describe how will your model help the bank.\n",
    "Data Desciption\n",
    "The dataset consists of the following types of files :\n",
    "\n",
    "AggregateData_Train/Test : Customer Savings account/Current Account transaction information for the training period.\n",
    "TransactionData_Train/Test :  Type of transactions done by a particular customer, aggregated at customer level for relevant training period.\n",
    "sample_submission.csv : Sample submission indicating the format of submission.\n",
